# ü¶∑ **DentalVision: Automated Teeth Segmentation for Dental Diagnostics** ü¶∑

DentalVision is an advanced tool designed to **automatically segment teeth** in **dental X-ray images** using cutting-edge **deep learning techniques**. The tool leverages **Vision Transformers (ViT)**, **ResNet-34**, and a **U-Net-style decoder** to provide fast and accurate segmentation results, enhancing **diagnostic workflows** in dentistry.


## üöÄ **Project Overview**

DentalVision is a powerful tool that automates the process of teeth segmentation in dental X-ray images, leveraging deep learning models like **Vision Transformer (ViT)** and **ResNet-34** (fine-tuned). The tool enhances diagnostic accuracy, reduces human error, and streamlines the diagnostic workflow for dental professionals.

- **Key features**:
  - **ViT-based Encoder + U-Net Decoder** for teeth segmentation.
  - **Fine-tuned ResNet-34** model for improved segmentation accuracy.
  - **Image Processing** Traditional Image pricessing techniques.
  - **Real-time results** through the interactive **Streamlit** web app.

## üß† Model Training
Vision Transformer (ViT) was used for feature extraction and segmentation, leveraging transformer-based self-attention to capture long-range dependencies within the image.

The model was trained with a binary cross-entropy loss function and Adam optimizer, yielding IoU of 0.82 and Dice coefficient of 0.89.

## üîÑ Model Fine-Tuning
The ResNet-34 model was fine-tuned for teeth segmentation. Using transfer learning, we adapted the pre-trained model to the dental X-ray dataset, significantly improving performance compared to traditional methods.

## üìä Results
The model achieved strong segmentation results:

IoU: 0.82 (Intersection over Union)

Dice Coefficient: 0.89

The results show that the ViT-based encoder with a U-Net decoder provides highly accurate segmentation masks. Furthermore, fine-tuning ResNet-34 improved the performance of the segmentation model.
